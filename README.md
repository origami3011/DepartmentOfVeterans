Department Of Veterans
Project - User Demographic Management
1.	Technology requirement
	Backend: ASP.NET 4.8 or .Net Core 3.1 +
	Front End: JS framework (Angular/React) or MVC (Razor)
	Code first or Database first with all scripts required for set up
	API â€“ document with Swagger, endpoint
User Case	
1.	Login with username and password
2.	Register new user
3.	User can be added by manual or loading from https://randomser.me/
4.	User Management (add/edit/delete)

2.	Technical approach
With that information, I came up with below solution and technical design 
Setting up application
Backend (Rest API)
â€¢	ASP.NET Core Web API 6 â€“ security with token base
â€¢	Clean architect principles (easy to maintenance and scalable if we can build from scratch)
â€¢	Code first
â€¢	Can be implemented parallel with FE team 
Client
â€¢	Built using MVC (ASP.NET Core 6) â€“ can be started when having model from BE team.
Class libraries
â€¢	.NET 6 class libraries
â€¢	AutoMapper library (mapping from one type to another type)
â€¢	Fluent Validation (Nuget package â€“ Adding a custom Validator)
â€¢	EntityFramework Core
â€¢	HttpClientFactory
â€¢	FE Code is generated from NSwagStudio
Design Pattern
â€¢	Using Meditor pattern (MediatR in .NET)
â€¢	Using Dependency of Inversion pattern
â€¢	Using CQRS pattern (Command â€“ Query Responsibility Segregation)
â€¢	API Gateway pattern
â€¢	Single Responsibility (SOLID) â€“ Separate create/update/query command
-	DRY (export, email function, HttpClientFactory feature from webUI)

3.	Project Info
The full source code can be download from GitHub as below:
https://github.com/origami3011/DepartmentOfVeterans.git
In other to run the application, we need to following below
Run update-database at Package Manager Console for both database DepartmentOfVeteransDb and DepartmentOfVeteransIdentityDb
update-database -context DepartmentOfVeteransDbContext
update-database -context DepartmentOfVeteransIdentityDbContext
 
If there is no issue occurs, we will see two databases like this from SQL Server Object Explorer
 
The application requires API service start first. 
Api - Right click on DepartmentOfVeterans.Api > View > View in browser (chrome)
 
App - Right click on DepartmentOfVeterans.WebMVC > View > View in browser (chrome)
 
APIs can be tested via Swagger or Postman before release to another team to implement UI.
Swagger
Token Generation: First, a token needs to be generated. This token is typically obtained through an authentication process, such as logging in with valid user credentials. 
Calling a Sub-API: Once you have the token, you can use it to access a specific sub-API related to user demographics. A sub-API is typically a part of a larger API that deals with a specific subset of data or functionality. 
Bearer Token Authentication: When making API calls to the User Demographic sub-API, you must include the bearer token in the request headers. Bearer token authentication is a common method of ensuring that only authorized users can access the API. The API server will verify the token to ensure the request is legitimate
 


Postman
You can download the collection and verify all api method beside Swagger UI. Follow the screenshot for 
sample. Donâ€™t forget to create {{token}} as variable to make the call easier.

Register login account
 
Authenticate api
 
Assign token to {{token}} variable
 

Conclusion
-	The application can be enhanced to better serve end users by incorporating additional features
o	Apply new modern layout (sample https://themeforest.net/item/sliced-aspnet-mvc-5-tailwind-css-admin-dashboard-template/47450107)
o	Add forgot password, user list, role base or enable F2A
o	Support upload file from client, add more user property
o	Export, email function should be function for next sprint
o	App may have some bugs (since doer could not be a good tester ðŸ˜Š)

Thank you and please comment and suggest to make it works better!!!
